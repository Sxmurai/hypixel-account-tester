# hypixel-account-tester
Tests hypixel accounts by logging them into the server and seeing if they're banned.

You can either use index.js for testing multiple accounts (see [example_accounts.txt](./example_accounts.txt))

Or for a single account, run testone.js with the argument format of email:password

Small shitty project I made for fun
